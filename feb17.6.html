                of joy and excitement in our life. Almost everyone wants to have a
                cute dog in his home. Breeding a dog requires the best care to make
                him healthy and happy.The dogs need an open, clean and secure environment 
                to play and grow.They also need a healthy diet with fresh water. It can
                prevent them from illness and increase their life span. A banded dog 
                tends to become irritable and unsocial. We must set them free most of the time.
                The regular exercise and timely visits to the doctor
                are the most important to keep them fit. Our care is their future.
